# The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, functions, modules) 
# should be open for extension but closed for modification.
# This means we should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

# Imagine you wrote a payment system. Tomorrow, you want to add a new payment method.
# If you modify existing classes every time, you risk breaking old functionality.
# Instead, by using the Open/Closed Principle, you design the system so new features can be a
# added without touching old code â€” usually achieved with inheritance or interfaces/abstraction.

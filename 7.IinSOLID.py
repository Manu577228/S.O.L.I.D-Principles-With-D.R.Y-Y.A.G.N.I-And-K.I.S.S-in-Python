# The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that a client should not be forced to
# depend on interfaces it does not use.
# Instead of creating one big interface with many methods,
# we should split it into smaller, more specific interfaces.

# In real life, not all objects need every method in a big interface.
# For example, if we create a Machine interface with methods like
# print(), scan(), and fax(), then a simple printer would be forced to implement
# scan() and fax() even if it doesnâ€™t support them.
# ISP says: "Break large interfaces into smaller, role-specific ones."

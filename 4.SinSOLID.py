# The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, 
# meaning it should handle only one specific responsibility. 
# This keeps the code modular, easy to maintain, and less error-prone.

# In Python, SRP means we design each class or function to do only one job.
# For example:

# A class that manages user data should not also handle writing data to files.

# By separating responsibilities, changes in one part of the system wonâ€™t break unrelated parts.

# This separation improves readability, testing, and scalability.
